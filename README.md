# CancelShapeshift

## Note: Rememb

A WoW Classic Addon to automatically cancel Druid forms and Shaman Ghost Wolf when talking to NPCs or using items.

When in any form, just talk to an NPC or use an item twice. First click: cancels form. Second click: Talks to NPC/Uses item.

Options:
```
Use /cancelshapeshift or /cs
/cancelshapeshift onability -- Cancels shapeshift when using an ability (Default: false)
```

I recommend leaving this option set to `false` and instead making a macro with `/cancelform` for abilities that you want to break your form.

## Note: Remember to remove "-master" from the folder name when putting it in your Addons folder.
